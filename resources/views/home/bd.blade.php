After endless hours in the state-of-art FLAVORGOD facilities I was able to perfect the blend for multiple seasonings that met every specification I had set out to meet without compromising flavor or quality! My goal is to keep seasonings chemical and filler free, keeping low salt levels, and always staying true to the herbs and spices that I use. Sacrificing nutritional value has never been an option. The health of people and the foods we eat on a daily basis is what truly matters to me.</p>
