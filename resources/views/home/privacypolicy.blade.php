                        <strong>Subscription Benefits</strong>
                        <p>This privacy statement covers the site at www.flavorgod.com.

That FG does not share user information except in limited circumstances. <br>3. What choices are available to users regarding collection, use and distribution of the information. <br>4. How users can correct any inaccuracies in the information.</p>
                        <strong>What information do we collect?</strong>
                        <p>We collect information from you when you register on our site, place an order, subscribe to our newsletter, respond to a survey or fill out a form. When ordering or registering on our site, as deemed appropriate, you may be asked to enter your: name, e-mail address, mailing address, phone number or credit card information. You may, however, visit our site anonymously.</p>
                        <p><strong>What do we use your information for?</strong></p>

                        <p><i>Log Files</i>
                        <br>Like most standard web sites, we use log files. This includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks to analyze trends, administer the site, track user’s movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. We use a tracking utility that collates data from log files to analyze user movement.</p>
                        <i>Communicate Special Offers and Updates</i>
                        <p>We send all new members a welcoming email to verify the desire to receive email from us. Established members will occasionally receive information on products, services, special deals, and a newsletter. Out of respect for the privacy of our users we present the option to not receive these types of communications. Please see the Choice/Opt Out section below.</p>
                        <i>Email Newsletter</i>
                        <p>If a user wishes to subscribe to our newsletter, we ask for contact information such as name and email address. Out of respect for our users privacy we provide a way for the user to opt out of these communications. Please see the Choice/Opt Out section below.</p>
                        <i>Provide Service Announcements</i>
                        <p>On rare occasions it is necessary to send out a strictly service related announcement. For instance, if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance we might send users an e-mail. Generally, users may not opt-out of these communications, though they can deactivate their account. However, these communications are not promotional in nature.</p>
                        <i>Customer Service</i>
                        <p>We communicate with users on a regular basis to provide requested services and with regard to issues relating to their account, we may reply via e-mail or phone.</p>
                        <strong>How do we protect your information?</strong>
                        <p>We implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your personal information when you place an order or enter, submit, or access your personal information.</p>
                        <p>Our website incorporates physical, electronic, and administrative procedures to safeguard the confidentiality of your personal information, including Secure Sockets Layer (“SSL”) for all financial transactions through the Site. We use SSL encryption to protect your personal information online, and we also take several steps to protect your personal information in our facilities. Access to your personal information is restricted. Only employees who need access to your personal information to perform a specific job are granted access to your personal information. Finally, we rely on third-party service providers for the physical security of some of our computer hardware. We believe that their security procedures are adequate. For example, when you visit the Site, you access servers that are kept in a secure physical environment, behind a locked cage and a hardware firewall.</p>
                        <p>While we use industry-standard precautions to safeguard your personal information, we cannot guarantee complete security. 100% complete security does not presently exist anywhere online or offline.</p>
                        <p>After a transaction, your private information (credit cards, social security numbers, financials, etc.) will not be stored on our servers.</p>
                        <p><strong>SHARING</strong></p>
                        <p><i>Legal Disclaimer</i>
                        <br>Though we make every effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose personal information when required by law where we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served on our web site. Where possible, we will notify affected users before disclosing information in response to a subpoena.</p> 
                        <i>Business Transitions</i><p>In the event FG goes through a business transition, such as a merger, being acquired by another company, or selling a portion of its assets, users’ personal information will, in most instances, be part of the assets transferred.</p>
                        <i>Links</i>
                        <p>This web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that we, FG, are not responsible for the privacy practices of any other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this web site.</p>
                        <i>Security</i>
                        <p>This web site takes every precaution to protect our users’ information. When users submit sensitive information via the web site, their information is protected both online and off-line.</p>
                        <p>When our order form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number and/or social security number), that information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry — SSL. While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of web browsers such as Google Chrome, Mozzilla Firefox, Safari, and Microsoft Internet Explorer, among others, becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when users are just ‘surfing’.</p>
                        <p>While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect user information off-line. All of our users’ information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job are granted access to personally identifiable information. Finally, the servers that store personally identifiable information are in a secure environment, in a locked facility.</p>
                        <i>Choice/Opt Out</i>
                        <p>Users who no longer wish to receive our newsletter or promotional communications may opt out of receiving these communications by sending email to <a href="mailto:unsubscribe@flavorgod.com" target="_top">unsubscribe@flavorgod.com</a></p>
